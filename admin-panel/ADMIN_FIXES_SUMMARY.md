# Admin Panel Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Technology License Constraint Error
**Problem**: License type constraint only allowed 'commercial' and 'personal' but form offered 'production'
**Solution**: 
- Updated `add_technology_license.html` to only show 'commercial' and 'personal' options
- Added validation in `add_technology_license()` route to reject invalid license types
- Improved date handling to automatically set `granted_at` to current timestamp

### 2. Missing Edit/Delete Routes for Technology Data & Ratios
**Problem**: Could not edit or delete technology data and ratios
**Solution**: Added complete CRUD functionality:
- `edit_technology_data(tech_type)` route + template
- `delete_technology_data(tech_type)` route
- `edit_technology_ratio(tech_type, level)` route + template  
- `delete_technology_ratio(tech_type, level)` route
- Updated list templates with edit/delete buttons

### 3. Missing Edit Routes for Technology Attributes
**Problem**: Could not edit technology attributes, only delete
**Solution**: 
- Added `edit_technology_attribute(tech_id, attribute_name)` route
- Created `edit_technology_attribute.html` template
- Updated `technology_attributes.html` with edit buttons

### 4. Missing Edit Routes for Country Technology Inventory
**Problem**: Could not edit country technology inventory quantities
**Solution**:
- Added `edit_country_tech_inventory(country_id, tech_id)` route
- Created `edit_country_tech_inventory.html` template
- Updated `country_tech_inventory.html` with edit buttons

### 5. Missing Edit/Delete Routes for Inventory Units
**Problem**: Could not edit or delete inventory unit quantities
**Solution**:
- Added `edit_inventory_unit(country_id, unit_type)` route + template
- Added `delete_inventory_unit(country_id, unit_type)` route
- Updated `inventory_units.html` with edit/delete buttons

### 6. Missing CRUD Routes for Diplomacy Tables
**Problem**: Could not create, edit, or delete treaties, alliances, or war declarations
**Solution**: Added complete CRUD functionality for all diplomacy tables:

**Treaties**:
- `add_treaty()` route + template
- `edit_treaty(treaty_id)` route + template
- `delete_treaty(treaty_id)` route
- Updated `treaties.html` with add/edit/delete buttons

**Alliances**:

- `add_war_declaration()` route + template
- `edit_war_declaration(war_id)` route + template
- `delete_war_declaration(war_id)` route
- Updated `war_declarations.html` with add/edit/delete buttons

### 7. Improved Server Settings
**Problem**: Default settings were basic and not useful for game management
**Solution**: Enhanced default settings with game-relevant options:
- Current day/season/year tracking
- Day duration in real minutes
- Research/production speed multipliers
- Technology transfer costs
- Alliance formation costs
- War declaration cooldowns
- Treaty negotiation times
- Player registration controls
- Discord notification settings

### 8. Date Handling Improvements
**Problem**: Date fields were not properly handled or defaulted
**Solution**:
- Added automatic timestamp generation for `granted_at` fields
- Improved date field handling in all forms
- Added proper date validation

### 9. Template Enhancements
**Problem**: Templates lacked proper CRUD controls and user-friendly interfaces
**Solution**:
- Added consistent edit/delete button styling
- Implemented proper confirmation dialogs for deletions
- Added JavaScript validation to prevent selecting same country twice in diplomacy forms
- Improved form layouts with Bootstrap styling
- Added helpful tooltips and field descriptions
