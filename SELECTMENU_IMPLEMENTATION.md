# Technology Form SelectMenu Implementation

This document explains the implementation of SelectMenu dropdown for the technology type field in the NEBot technology creation system.

## Problem Solved

Previously, the "Type de technologie" field was a text input where users had to manually type the technology type (e.g., "Char Moyen", "Fusil d'Assaut", "Destroyer"). This approach was:
- Prone to typos and inconsistent formatting
- Required users to remember exact type names
- Did not enforce validation of acceptable types

## Solution Implemented

The system now uses a Discord SelectMenu (dropdown) that:
- Shows only valid technology types for each specialisation
- Prevents invalid type entries
- Provides a better user experience with predefined options
- Automatically formats the selected value consistently

## Technical Implementation

### 1. New TechTypeSelectView Class

```python
class TechTypeSelectView(discord.ui.View):
    """View with a SelectMenu for choosing technology type."""
```

This class creates a Discord View containing a SelectMenu populated with the `accepted_types` from the technology specialisation configuration.

**Features:**
- Converts snake_case values to Title Case for display (e.g., `char_leger` â†’ `Char Leger`)
- Stores the display name in the form data
- Provides a callback mechanism to continue with the form after selection

### 2. Modified UniversalTechForm Class

The modal form class now:
- Detects when the `type_technologie` field is present
- Skips creating a TextInput for this field
- Stores metadata about the skipped field for later processing

**Key changes:**
```python
# Skip type_technologie field as it will be handled by SelectMenu
if field_config["key"] == "type_technologie":
    self.has_type_field = True
    self.type_field_config = field_config
    continue
```

### 3. Enhanced MultiFormView Logic

The form view now intelligently handles forms containing the type field:
- Checks if a form contains the `type_technologie` field
- Shows the SelectMenu first if the type hasn't been selected yet
- Continues with the normal modal flow after type selection

## User Experience Flow

### Before (Text Input)
1. User clicks form button
2. Modal opens with text field "Type de technologie"
3. User must type exact type name
4. Risk of typos and invalid entries

### After (SelectMenu)
1. User clicks form button
2. **If form contains type field and type not yet selected:**
   - SelectMenu view appears with dropdown
   - User selects from predefined options
   - Modal opens with remaining fields
3. **If type already selected or not in current form:**
   - Modal opens normally

## Configuration

The system uses the `accepted_types` array from each specialisation in `tech_form_datas.json`:

```json
{
    "armes": {
        "accepted_types": ["fusil_dassaut", "mitrailleuse", "sniper"],
        // ... other config
    },
    "navale": {
        "accepted_types": ["destroyer", "croiseur", "porte_avions", "sous_marin", "corvette", "fregate"],
        // ... other config
    },
    "aerienne": {
        "accepted_types": ["chasseur", "bombardier", "transport", "drone", "helicoptere", "reconnaissance"],
        // ... other config
    },
    "terrestre": {
        "accepted_types": ["char_leger", "char_moyen", "char_lourd", "vehicule_blinde", "transport_troupe", "artillerie"],
        // ... other config
    }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Data Consistency:** All technology types are now standardized
2. **User Experience:** Intuitive dropdown interface instead of text input
3. **Validation:** Impossible to enter invalid types
4. **Maintainability:** Easy to add/remove valid types through JSON configuration
5. **Internationalization:** Display names can be easily modified without changing logic
6. **Error Prevention:** Eliminates typos and formatting inconsistencies

## Future Enhancements

- Add icons/emojis to SelectMenu options
- Support for dynamic type lists based on technology level
- Multi-select for hybrid technologies
- Integration with autocomplete for other form fields

## Technical Notes

- Discord modals only support TextInput components, not SelectMenu
- The solution uses a separate View with SelectMenu before showing the modal
- The ephemeral response ensures the SelectMenu doesn't clutter the channel
- Form data is preserved between the SelectMenu and modal interactions
- The system gracefully falls back to normal behavior if `accepted_types` is not defined
